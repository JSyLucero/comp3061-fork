## Setting up virtual machines on lab computers

*Perform the steps below in sequence*

1a. [Create Windows Server 2012 R2 virtual machine using VMware workstation.](https://vimeo.com/232280142/b336d48d38)   

1b. [Create Windows 7 Professional virtual machine using VMware workstation.](https://vimeo.com/232280302/6abf0cc038)      

1c. [Create live boot of Kali Linux virtual machine and verify that all the virtual machines (Windows 7, Server and Kali Linux) are pinging each other.](https://vimeo.com/232280872/4d022c34a4) **(prerequisite lab 1a and 1b)**  

1d. Creating a domain in Windows Server 2012 and connecting Windows 7 Professional as a client to the domain. **(prerequisite lab 1a and 1b)**    

### *__Please note that use recommended disk location provided in the lab. Saving large files anywhere other than recommended location would severely affect the performance of the OS.__*

## Setting up virtual machines on personal computers  

You need a VMware workstation player to create virtual machines. Download [VMware workstation player](https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0).  

After successfully installed VMware Workstation player, follow steps 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d in sequence.  

### *__Please note that I do not recommend setting up virtual machines in both lab and personal computers and transfer virtual machines back and forth via USB flash/hard drive/SSD. In the past, the VMs got corrupted due to transfer large amount of files frequently.__*
